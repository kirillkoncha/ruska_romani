# Russian and Ruska Romani Parallel Corpus

The parallel corpus for the Ruska Romani dialect and Russian language.

Ruska Romani is the dialect of Romani language attributed to Ruska Roma, the largest subgroup of Romani people in Russia.

The corpus contains the translations of Russian literature into Ruska Romani dialect.

The corpus creation involved manual alignment of a small part of translations with original works, fine-tuning a language model on the aligned pairs, and using the fine-tuned model to align the remaining data. Ruska Romani sentences were annotated using a morphological analyzer, with rules crafted for proper nouns and borrowings. 

The corpus includes 88,742 Russian tokens and 84,635 Ruska Romani tokens, 74,291 of which were grammatically annotated.

The corpus could be used for linguistic research, including comparative and diachronic studies, bilingual dictionary creation, stylometry research, and NLP/MT tool development for Ruska Romani.
